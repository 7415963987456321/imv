                         imv Contributing Guidelines
                         ===========================

1) Please keep pull requests rebased onto the latest master. All merges should
   be simple fast-forward merges. While rebasing, tidy up and merge your commits
   as you think appropriate.

2) Please ensure that your changes fit with the existing coding style of imv.
   Strictly no tabs, and 2 spaces of indentation.

3) All contributions must be provided under the license included with imv: the
   GNU General Public License Version 2. You retain the copyright ownership of
   any contributions you make.

4) If your pull request isn't immediately accepted please don't take it
   personally. We hope to retain a high level of code quality as the project
   matures.
